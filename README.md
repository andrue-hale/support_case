## Development Server

  

This is an Angular 7.2 application.

Before you begin make sure your development environment includes Node.js and an npm package manager.

  

1. Angular requires Node.js version 10.9.0 or later

-  To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.

2. This setup guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.

- To check that you have the npm client installed, run `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.

  

####  In order to set up the development server please follow the steps below:

  

Run `npm install`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

  

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

  

## Important Notes:

- Functions were purposely left empty in the cart.component.ts file. Writing the logic to make these functions work, and adding supporting .html will be the bulk of the case.
